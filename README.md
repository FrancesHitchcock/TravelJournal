# Travel Journal Solo Project - Scrimba Module 11: React Basics 

## About The Project

This Project was built alone and unaided following the second of a total of four sections in this first Scrimba React module. An example data object was provided by Scrimba as a starter. A Figma file was provided for the basic layout, but the project itself adopted a responsive layout according to the 'mobile-first' principle. 

The page is built using React components and demonstrates passing of an entire object as a prop. React keys are used for identification of individual objects. Vite was used to create a local React app.

The requirements of the project were as follows:

- The data array should be in a separate .js file
- Use .map() and React props to render a set of travel locations
- Use styling to give a polished finish

All requirements were met.
